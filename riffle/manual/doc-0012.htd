The _HREF(doc-0041.htm,menubar) allows you to perform many functions
such as loading and saving files, creating new projects and dialogs,
undo/redo, invoking help, and so on. Try to remember the keyboard shortcuts that are
displayed next to the menu item labels - they can save you a lot of time
and make your Riffle experience more natural and enjoyable.
