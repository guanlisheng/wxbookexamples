The main toolbar gives quick access to commonly-used commands.
If you hold your mouse pointer over the toolbar buttons, a tooltip pops up with a short description
of the button's function. You can choose to hide the toolbar altogether
using the <B>View | Show Main Toolbar</B> menu command.<P>
You can find out more about in the _HREF(doc-0042.htm,main toolbar commands) topic.<P>
